    "answer": "I am fullstack web developer who has been building websites for over three years now. I have a strong background in React and use Figma and CSS to deliver websites with responsive layouts.\n\nI have deployed software to multiple cloud providers, including AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Firebase. I'm experienced with Node.js having used it with Express and Firebase Functions.\n\nI'm UX focused and enjoy developing front end interfaces. Design is very important to me, to the extent that I have developed my own icon set for one of my projects."

    "id": "3",
    "title": "What are your weaknesses?",
    "answer": "I struggle to let go of projects I have worked on. With contract work, even after a projects has been delivered, I keep thinking of ways to further optimise or improve it. \n\nAt this point, the work has already been finished and it's not worth another contract for a small optimisation fix. I find it frustrating when I have to keep switching projects."

    "title": "Tell me about a time you showed leadership",
    "answer": "After basic militarisation in the UAS, I joined a Fieldcraft course that included a 3 day blank firing exercise in the Yorkshire Moors.\n\nOn the first day of the exercise, we were tasked to walk as a squad through a valley where we going to be ambushed.\n\nWe had been taught the tactics to respond to this and had practiced firing the weapons but this was the first time to experience them together.\n\nOthers were hesitant to lead the squad so I volunteered and, at the time of the ambush, I found that the training I had been given was adequate to withdraw the squad to a safe position.\n\nI found it an excellent opportunity to test what I had learned under pressure, as well as good test of my verbal and non-verbal communication skills."

    "id": "5",
    "title": "Describe a challenging project you worked on.",
    "answer": "One of my most challenging projects has been Hiking Network. My goal was to deploy a route planning application that could run with up to 5,000 users a month without costing me anything.\n\nThis required careful optimisation. For example, Mapbox, used to load and render the map, provides an option to pay per map load, so the application was built around a single map that loads once per user.\n\nFor images, I bundled a low resolution version with the code and dynamically loaded the higher resolution version from a storage bucket at runtime, using a CSS transition to smoothly fade between them. This decreased hosting usage without increasing load times.\n\nIt's in beta testing at the moment and usage has aligned with the 5,000 user a month goal."

    "id": "6",
    "title": "How do you prioritize your tasks?",
    "answer": "When I've worked on my own software projects, I use issues on GitHub to prioritise tasks. Anything that needs doing is added to the issues and urgent tasks are given a priority tag. \n\nIn contract work, I've provided a document outlining what tasks are necessary and what can be done if there's time to spare.\n\nI find it useful to always have an idea of what needs to be done next."

    "title": "Can you describe a time when you had to learn a new technology quickly?",
    "answer": "In one of my contracts for KSR, I was tasked with deploying an AI application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, which I had not used before. To learn quickly, I started by watching YouTube tutorials to get a basic overview. After this I read through the relevant documentation and started working.\n\nI encountered an issue where the upload would time out when attempting to deploy the full application. To resolve this I consulted Stack Overflow and found that it was due to the size of the application exceeding available space. I resolved this and successfully deployed the software."

  {
    "id": "15",
    "title": "What is the difference between let, const, and var in JavaScript?",
    "answer": "Using var was the original way to declare variables in JavaScript. It is function-scoped, which means that it is only accessible within the function where it is declared. Both let and const are block-scoped, which means they only exist within the nearest pair of curly braces. \n\nAttempting to access a var before it is defined will return undefined. Attempting to access let and const will throw a ReferenceError. Const cannot be changed once defined."
