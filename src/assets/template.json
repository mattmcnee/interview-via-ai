    "answer": "After basic militarisation in the UAS, I joined a Fieldcraft course that included a 3 day blank firing exercise in the Yorkshire Moors.\n\nOn the first day of the exercise, we were tasked to walk as a squad through a valley where we going to be ambushed.\n\nWe had been taught the tactics to respond to this and had practiced firing the weapons but this was the first time to experience them together.\n\nOthers were hesitant to lead the squad so I volunteered and, at the time of the ambush, I found that the training I had been given was adequate to withdraw the squad to a safe position.\n\nI found it an excellent opportunity to test what I had learned under pressure, as well as good test of my verbal and non-verbal communication skills."

    "title": "Describe a challenging project you worked on.",
    "answer": "One of my most challenging projects has been Hiking Network. My goal was to deploy a route planning application that could run with up to 5,000 users a month without costing me anything.\n\nThis required careful optimisation. For example, Mapbox, used to load and render the map, provides an option to pay per map load, so the application was built around a single map that loads once per user.\n\nFor images, I bundled a low resolution version with the code and dynamically loaded the higher resolution version from a storage bucket at runtime, using a CSS transition to smoothly fade between them. This decreased hosting usage without increasing load times.\n\nIt's in beta testing at the moment and usage has aligned with the 5,000 user a month goal."
